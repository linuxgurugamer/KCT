1.4.13 
	Thanks to github user @AlexSkylark for this:
		Added a call to GameEvent.Fire() in the event handler that adds science from BPs ("Research" on R&D tab) so other mods that manipulate science gain (i.e. Bureaucracy) can intercept it.

	Updated version file to use github for version info

	Thanks to @tivec for this:
		Add scroll position for build plan window
	Thanks to @DarthPointer for this:
		Build Points of merged vessels is now calculated in a better way, now consistent with parameter name "Merging Time Percent".
		KRASH simulation was reenabling merge buttons for already-merged vessels.

1.4.10
	Added stock alarm clock functionality to mirror the KAC alarm clock functionality (bugs and all).  This is only for KSP 1.12

1.4.9
	Added code to check for kerbals in external seats, and to disallow recover if occupied. Tested in both Editor and Tracking Station
	Changed min version to be 1.10.1.  will probably work for the 1.8+, but no support

1.4.8.1
	Removed option to Recover to VAB & Recover to SPH for eva'd kerbals

1.4.8 
	Thanks to @siimav for this:
		Fix airlaunched vessels flipping out with Principia
	Thanks to user @DarthPointer for this:
		Added vessel merging
			How to use it:
			You build some vessels or recover them (merging only operates vessels that are in storages)
			Start editing any vessel from the storage
			Open merging selection
			Pick a vessel you want to merge (make sure its root is attachable, just as with stock ship merging)
			The achieved BP progress will be FullMergedVessel * (1 - ConfigurablePercent/100), FullMergedVessel is Build Points for a craft made of merged vessels.
	Added public methods for needed access by L-Tech mod

1.4.7.14
	PR submitted by @DarthPointer to support his mod:
		Setting isKCTBuilt = true fields for all the modules KCT sees in the ship's config tree

1.4.7.13
	* Apparently there are mods that define custom KSC facility types. Those cannot currently be 
	  resolved to the KSP SpaceCenterFacility enum and will cause facility upgrade attempts to fail.
	  I made KCT_UpgradingBuilding.facilityType field nullable so that any custom facilities
	  would just be null there. In the process I also found out that KSP is unable to automatically 
	  persist nullable enums so a workaround had to be written for that.
	* All spent funds that are related to vessel building & rollout are now logged under 
	  TransactionReasons.VesselRollout.  This is rather important for RP-1 career logger.

1.4.7.12
	Thanks to user @siimav for the following:
		Fix vessel Situation snapping to Landed on airlaunch
		Add more custom events
		Fix deleting a pad causing issues with other pad constructions
		Fix vessel Situation snapping to Landed on airlaunch

	Fixed small memory leak by replacing all the "new Wait4Second" with constants
	Fixed big memory lean (1-3 meg/sec) caused by needless changing of textures in the toolbar buttons
	Removed unused function:  GetStockButtonTexture, not needed since the ToolbarController handles all of that 
	Fixed the unable to resize Blizzy's toolbar when KCT icon is transferred to it
	Added AirLaunch configs

1.4.7.9
	Removed old #if which was disabling the multiple launchsites
